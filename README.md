# ðŸ“‰ Telco Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

This project is a complete end-to-end solution for predicting customer churn in a telecom company. 
It combines data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using **Streamlit** as an interactive dashboard.

##  Project Overview

- **Problem**: Predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their account information and service usage.
- **Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- **Goal**: Build a predictive model and provide business insights using interactive visualizations and a prediction tool.

##  Model Development

- Used a pipeline with `ColumnTransformer` for preprocessing:
  - StandardScaler for numerical features
  - OneHotEncoding for categorical features
- Binary columns (e.g., `Partner`, `SeniorCitizen`) were handled properly
- Optimized using GridSearchCV with **Recall** as the scoring metric
- Final model: **Logistic Regression**
